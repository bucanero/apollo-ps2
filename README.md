# Usage

Using the application is simple and straight-forward: 

 - Move <kbd>UP</kbd>/<kbd>DOWN</kbd> to select the save-game file you want to patch, and press ![X button](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/CROSS.png). The patch screen will show the available fixes for the file. Select the patches and click `Apply`.
 - To view the item's details, press ![Triangle](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/TRIANGLE.png).
It will open the context menu on the screen. Press ![O button](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/CIRCLE.png) to return to the list.
 - To reload the list, press ![Square](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/SQUARE.png).
 - Press <kbd>L1</kbd>/<kbd>L2</kbd> or <kbd>R1</kbd>/<kbd>R2</kbd> trigger buttons to move pages up or down.

# Online Database

The application also provides direct access to the [Apollo online database](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves) of save-game files for PlayStation Portable games.
These usually offer additional features such as completed games that can save you many hours of playing.

The Online Database project aims to [add more save-games](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves/issues/new/choose) shared by the community.

# FAQs

 1. Where I can get a save-game for *XYZ game*?
    
    You can check sites like [Brewology.com](https://ps3.brewology.com/gamesaves/savedgames.php?page=savedgames&system=psp), and [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/). Also, searching on [Google](http://www.google.com) might help.
 1. I have a save-game file that I want to share. How can I upload it?
    
    If you have a save file that is not currently available on the Online Database and want to share it, please check [this link](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves) for instructions.
 1. Why is it called **Apollo**?
    
    [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo) was the twin brother of [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis), goddess of the hunt. Since this project was born using the [Artemis-GUI](https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ArtemisPS3/) codebase, I decided to respect that heritage by calling it Apollo.

- [libxmp](https://github.com/pspdev/psp-packages/tree/master/libxmp) library
- [libZip](https://github.com/pspdev/psp-packages/tree/master/libzip) library
